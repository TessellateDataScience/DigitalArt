# Summary of program
Tesselate Data Science would like to offer a learning program that is run as an adjunct to school-based learning, aimed at learners in years 10 to 12. This program will include the development of computer programming skills and application of these skills to producing a product or service that helps address a social problem. Themes covered in the program include: computational science, teamwork and collaboration, and social entrepreneurship.

# Program evaluation and development approach
Prior to offering the program we will evaluate it to ensure it is effective, against various metrics (to be determined). We will develop the program in consultation with a range of expertise from computer science, teaching, and business. We will develop the program using an iterative approach using 'design thinking' as a reference point.

# Program influencers and content
As to this program development, we have ideas of some entities and software that we want to have influence within our program (more details below) as they:  
- have a mission that resonates with us
- have learning content that we believe is accessible/appealing to a wider audience

## Influencer: Processing
[Processing](https://processing.org/) is a digital sketchbook that promotes programming in the artistic community. It's developed using funding obtained from the Processing Foundation, which has a goal to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and work with code, especially those who might not have access to these resources.

## Influencer: OpenMM
[OpenMM](https://openmm.org/) is a toolkit for molecular simulation using high-performance, GPU-based code. It is developed by a group of researchers and software developers with funding obtained from both the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative & National Institutes of Health. We believe OpenMM's simulations could lead to lower-cost, more-equitable vaccines that ultimately help significantly more people.
